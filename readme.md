My name is Aayushi Mathur . I am from Noida and I am in the first year of my undergrad in Btech CSE with a specialization in Artificial intelligence and machine learning from Golgotia university. I have completed my schooling at Vishwa Bharti Public School Noida. I have also completed a certification course from Udemy in python. My strength is I am self-motivated, do hard work, and like to learn from watching different people. My weakness is that I won't feel good until my work is completed and sometimes I overthink a lot. I am interested in Android development so I am learning java to start my journey towards being an android developer. My Short term goal right now is to learn kotlin after java and to learn more in the future how to create beautiful applications.
